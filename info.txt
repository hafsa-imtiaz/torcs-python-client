### **Stored Data in the CSV File**
The script collects and stores **all relevant telemetry data** from the TORCS simulation. Below is a breakdown of **what is stored**:

#### **1. Core Vehicle State (Single-Value Sensors)**
| Field        | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `curLapTime` | Current lap time in seconds. |
| `distFromStart` | Distance from the start line in meters. |
| `distRaced` | Total distance raced in meters. |
| `fuel` | Remaining fuel (irrelevant since we have unlimited fuel). |
| `gear` | Current gear (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.). |
| `lastLapTime` | Time taken for the last completed lap in seconds. |
| `racePos` | Current position in the race. |
| `rpm` | Revolutions per minute (RPM) of the engine. |
| `speedX` | Forward speed of the car. |
| `speedY` | Sideways speed of the car. |
| `speedZ` | Vertical speed of the car. |
| `trackPos` | Car's position relative to the center of the track. |
| `angle` | Angle between the car's heading and track axis. |
| `damage` | Car's damage level (not useful since we disabled damage). |
| `z` | Car's altitude above the track. |

---

#### **2. Track Sensors (List of 19 Values)**
| Field Format | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `track_0` to `track_18` | Distance to the track boundaries at different angles (e.g., directly ahead, slightly left, etc.). |

- These sensors help the car understand its position on the track.

---

#### **3. Opponent Sensors (List of 36 Values)**
| Field Format | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `opponent_0` to `opponent_35` | Distance to the nearest opponent cars in different directions. |

- Since the values are `200.0`, it suggests no nearby opponents.

---

#### **4. Wheel Spin Velocity (List of 4 Values)**
| Field Format | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `wheelSpin_0` to `wheelSpin_3` | Measures wheel slip/spin for each wheel. |

- Can be used to detect oversteering or loss of traction.

---

### **Data NOT Being Stored**
1. **Focus Sensors (`focus`)**
   - Values are all `-1`, meaning they are disabled.
   - They would typically track distant points on the track ahead.

2. **Noisy/Damage Sensors**
   - Damage data is stored (`damage`), but it is irrelevant because we disabled car damage.

3. **Fuel Level**
   - We store `fuel`, but it's unnecessary since fuel is unlimited.

---

### **Final Summary**
✅ **Stored:**
- Core car state (speed, position, RPM, lap times, gear, etc.).
- Track boundary distances (19 sensors).
- Opponent distances (36 sensors).
- Wheel spin velocities (4 sensors).

❌ **Not Stored:**
- Focus sensors (`focus`).
- Noise-related data (since we disabled noisy sensors).
- Damage (irrelevant because we turned off car damage).
